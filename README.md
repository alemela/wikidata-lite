# wikidata-lite
We're collecting lot of knowledge in Wikidata and this is awsome. Some of us also want to use it in some werd project.
Unfortunately Wikidata RDF dumps (https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/) are really big.
Even the official SPARQL endpoint is under pressure by the huge amount of data under it. At the present time only simple queries or 
specific patterns see the light.

We need more light. So why we need a Wikidata...lite!

In most of our use cases we don't need the entire sum of knowledge contained in the full graph. 
Probably we just need the tip of the iceberg. 
The idea behind this repository is to create simple receipes, with less fats and more of what you like!
So you can generate only the portion of Wikidata graph you need, reducing the cost of hardware and increasing the feasibility of your queries.
